                    <p>Don't stop yourself from having a good cry if you feel one coming on. Accept the feelings you have, rather than think you "should" feel a different way.</p>

                    <p>Some people want to tell the story of their loss or talk about their feelings. But sometimes people don't feel like talking. That's OK, too. No one should feel pressured to talk.</p>
